This is the classic n queens problem. 

Where you have an n by n chess board and you're tasked with placing n queens on this board such that no queens are a threat to each other based off the rules of chess. ie. Queens cannot be places on the same row, column or diagonal.

This program exhausts all possible solutions using a recursive backtracking algorithm. 

How to interpret outputs:

For n=4 the outputs are 

1 3 0 2 
2 0 3 1 

Visually the first solution '1 3 0 2' looks like this:
   _ _ _ _ 
3 |  Q    |
2 | 	 Q|
1 |Q	  |
0 |_ _ Q _|

The second will look like this:
   _ _ _ _ 
3 |    Q  |
2 |Q	  |
1 | 	 Q|
0 |_ Q _ _|

As you can see the numbers correspond to the row number. 

If the nth number in a given solution is k then the coordinate will be (k, n).


Note that I developed this solution to the problem in Level 2 of Exam03. Although I didn't submit the solution in time I formalised it here as it's quite straight forward.

Also note that the solution may have leaks.
